          'It has been a pleasure working with DocEM over the past 3 years. The best part is the personal attention that we always got whenever needed. We were very nervous starting our new Brokerage but DocEM has supported and guided us all the way. We really thank DocEM for their continued support and the improvements that they are making in the software based on the feedback from us and RECO. We wish DocEM continued growth and hope their team will keep up the service standards that we have become so used to.',

          'It is amazing to see how DocEM has evolved through the years.  We were among the first clients in 2013, back then we had fewer agents.  Now with hundreds of agents and a higher volume of transactions, we could not operate without it.  We take full advantage of the capabilities offer by the software.  It definitely improves and simplifies our processes.   They keep innovating rapidly and meeting our specific demands.  They are always available to support our team.',

          'We started using DocEM in 2014 and we never looked back. We were searching for an easy to use, yet reliable platform to manage all of our document storage and broker management. DocEM is a systematic, yet user-friendly online based platform, designed to be practical, not just to be used on an administrative level, but on an individual broker level. The customer service is equal to none. Anderson and his team are always on call to help out when needed,  and they work with you to make sure that their platform fits your unique business needs. These are true professionals. We are glad to be working with such a dedicated and competent team and plan to continue with them for the years to come.',
